            <p>
              I joined Google NYC in 2015, and currently manage a team focused
              on building core services and infrastructure that provide fresh
              and relatable content from the web to a wide range of Google
              products, including Gemini, Discover, Maps, and new LLM-based

              I'm a strong advocate for team culture rooted in psychological
              safety and growth opportunities, having found that this makes a
              team greater than the sum of its parts.
